                    BTS has come back with their third mini album, The most beautiful moment in life pt.1.<br><br>
                    After successfully concluding the “School Trilogy” that discusses the main topics of interest for teens—dreams, happiness and love—the new album begins to discuss “youth”. BTS has chosen the theme of “the most beautiful moment in life”, the start of one's young adulthood in which beauty coexists with uncertainty.
                    <br><br>The most beautiful moment in life pt.1 focuses on the uncertain future more than the glamour of youth. In addition, while previous lyrical work had been credited to the rappers (RM, SUGA and j-hope), the vocal members (Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook) have now added their names to the credits for this album's producing and songwriting.<br><br><br><br>
