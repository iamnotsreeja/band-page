                <p>BTS released the new anthology album Proof on June 10, 11 months after their latest single CD Butter. Proof is the core of BTS' history. The new three-CD album introduces three new tracks, one in each CD: “Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)”, “Run BTS” and “For Youth”, each in different genres conveying their own messages.<br><br>
                    The album comprises 48 tracks total, from the greatest hit songs, and solo/sub-unit tracks selected by each member, unreleased tracks to special tracks.<br><br>
                    CD1, the “BTS chronicle”, comprises 19 tracks including lead singles of BTS' albums in a chronological order, including the new lead single “Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment).”<br><br>
                    CD2 is a collection of 15 solo/sub-unit tracks, all selected by the members. It is imbued with the septet's own thoughts, emotions and stories. CD2 starts with the brand new “Run BTS.”<br><br>
                    Dedicated to their fans ARMY, CD3 includes tracks that members worked on previously but have not been released in the previous albums, demo versions of already released tracks in BTS’ younger voices vividly capturing the moments back in time, and a new fan song, “For Youth.”<br><br><br><br>
