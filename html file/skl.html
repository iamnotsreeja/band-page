                <h3>THE 2ND MINI ALBUM</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>With their previous two albums, 2 COOL 4 SKOOL and O!RUL8,2?, 
                    BTS sang about the dreams and happiness of teens. The songs spoke about young people
                     living without a dream and schools that force rigid and homogenous thought onto its students. 
                     The new album, released on February 12, continues to focus on school and teens. As hinted by the title, 
                     SKOOL LUV AFFAIR, the album's main theme is the love that blossoms in the school. This album is a culmination 
                     of the “School Trilogy” project that discusses the topics of most interest to teens their own age—dreams, happiness and love. 
                     Such penetrating insight into the hearts and minds of young people led to the absolute support that BTS has 
                     received from fans their age. The members again directly participated in the making of the songs,
                     vowing to ensure that the songs reflect the reality of the music fans of their own generation..<br><br><br><br>
