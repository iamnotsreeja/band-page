                    BTS debut track “No More Dream”!
                    A fresh new take on 90s hip hop!
                    A new, bold message from hip hop boyband BTS!
                    “What is your dream”?<br><br>
                    Hip hop group BTS has released its debut single 2 COOL 4 SKOOL.
                     While billed as a single, the album boasts an impressive 27-minute runtime.
                     This is the product of the firm conviction and passion of BTS that hip hop
                      musicians must make their voices heard through their albums. Each member 
                      flexed their musical prowess by taking part in creating the lyrics and music
                       for every song on the album. BTS has repeatedly said that “hip hop is genuine
                        music for telling one own story,” and indeed the members rap about their 
                        own experiences and emotions. There is no discontinuity between the emotions 
                        and lyrics of BTS. The album is a satisfaction in both quality and quantity.<br><br><br><br>
