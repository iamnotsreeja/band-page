                <p>n their first studio album in a year and two months, BTS sings about love gone awry in DARK & WILD.
                     They warn the girl who acts like she doesn't love them not to test their love anymore.<br><br>
                     The boys are no longer in their school uniforms. They have become tougher, 
                     singing that their love is not to be treated lightly. A year and two months into their debut,
                      BTS made sure that the visuals, performance and all the elements of their first studio album are flawless. 
                      Tracks that highlight the different genres of hip hop—South, West, Boom Bap and Trap—provide 
                      a clear direction of BTS' music. The title track “Danger” is a tightly-composed hybrid hip hop 
                      song with a piercing punk-rock guitar 
                     sound that features stark rap, a powerful hook and exhilarating shouting.<br><br><br><br>
