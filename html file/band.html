        <p>Since their inception, BTS have emphasized hip hop as their musical base,
             largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers;
              during early visits to the US, the group received mentoring from American rappers.
              Bang Si-hyuk previously acknowledged that K-pop as a whole draws from black music,
              and author Crystal S. Anderson stated, "BTS's rising popularity in the US represents
               the continuation of the ways that K-pop functions as part of a global R&B tradition."
               T.K. Park and Youngdae Kim of Vulture deemed the track "Outro: Her" from Love Yourself: 
               Her as the best example of the group's understanding of old-school hip hop, with raps inspired by Chuck D
             and Tupac and jazzy chords from the 1990s to create a classic hip hop sound.<br><br>
             The release of "Blood Sweat & Tears" in 2016 accelerated BTS's transition from a hip hop to a pop group. Park and Kim noted that the song draws from dancehall, reggaeton, and moombahton but opts for a "baroque mysticism" rather than the "partylike atmosphere of its influences".[303] The group also began incorporating traditional Korean elements into their music. For example, their single "Idol" (2018) features an adlib from Pansori, a Korean form of operatic storytelling, and vocal imitations of the sounds of Korean janggu drums.[306]

While BTS maintains roots in hip hop, their sound has diversified. 
They first experimented with R&B, rock and jazz hip hop on Dark & Wild in 2014;
EDM in their The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series;
moombahton and tropical house on Wings and You Never Walk Alone ;
future bass and Latin pop in their Love Yourself album series;slow-dance ballads,emo rap, Afro pop,
funk, trap, pop rock, and hip pop in their Map of the Soul album series;
and disco in their single "Dynamite". The band members have explored different genres on solo tracks, 
such as neo soul on V's "Stigma" and flowing R&B on Jimin's "Lie".

        <p>
            Since their formation, BTS have believed that telling their own stories is the 
            best way for the younger generation to relate to their music.Writing many of their own lyrics,
            the group discusses universal life experiences such as sadness and loneliness in their work and
             turn them into something lighter and more manageable. RM stated that BTS tries to avoid a preaching 
             or reprimanding tone in their songs "because that's not the way that we want to spread our message ...
              We're born with different lives, but you cannot choose some things. So we thought that love, 
              the real meaning of it, starts with loving ourselves and 
            accepting some ironies and some destinies that we have from the very start.<br><br>
            Themes explored in BTS's discography range from exploring "the troubles and anxieties 
            of school-age youth" to "themes like love, friendship, loss, death, and more."
            Early BTS songs, such as "No More Dream" and "N.O" from their school trilogy, 
            were described by Tamar Herman as motivated by personal experiences with South Korea's 
            rigid approach to education and called for change to the educational system and societal 
            expectations.The members' experiences with South Korean youth culture also inspired the songs
             "Dope" and "Silver Spoon" (Korean: 뱁새; RR: Baepsae) from their youth trilogy. These songs
              reference generational disparity and millennials giving up romantic relationships, marriage, 
              children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and 
              societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations.
              The group's label dubbed The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever, 
              the conclusion to their youth trilogy, "a special album that marks the conclusion of
               the epic journey of the series, containing the last stories told by young people who, 
               despite an uncertain and insecure reality (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 1
               ) continue to surge forward (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 2)."
               Wings focused on mental health, criticisms of the K-pop "idol" scene, and
                delivering a female empowerment message.The Love Yourself series introduced new 
                themes regarding youth culture in South Korea, including the excitement of love, 
                pain of farewell, and enlightenment of self-love.According to Kathy Sprinkel, 
                BTS's 2020 "quarantine album" Be "chronicles the group's coming to terms with
                 a suddenly new reality and offers support for their listeners going through the
                  same upheaval and uncertainty".<br><br>
                  BTS's lyrics have also addressed topics outside youth culture.
                   The song "Am I Wrong" from Wings questioned societal apathy towards changing the status quo;
                    the lyric "We're all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we're angry" appeared to reference 
                    South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook, who advocated a caste system 
                    for the country and who reportedly described average people as "dogs and pigs".
                     BTS released the song amid the 2016 South Korean political scandal that resulted 
                     in the impeachment of president Park Geun-hye. RM and Suga's personal struggles
                      with mental health have inspired some of their music. "Not Today" from 2017's You Never
                       Walk Alone is an anti-establishment anthem, urging "all the underdogs in the world" to keep fighting,
                        and "Spring Day" honored the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy.
                        Journalist Jeff Benjamin praised BTS in Fuse for "speak[ing] honestly about 
                        topics they deem important, even in a conservative society".
                        Former South Korean president Moon Jae-in said: "Each of the seven members sings
                         in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. 
                  Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions."

        <h2>Influences</h2>
    </div>
  
    <div class="para-2">
        <p>
            BTS have cited Seo Taiji and Boys,[290] Nas, Eminem, Kanye West, Drake, Post Malone, Charlie Puth, and Danger as musical inspirations.[291] They have also cited Queen as an influence, saying they "grew up watching videos of Live Aid".[292] During their concert at Wembley Stadium in London, Jin paid tribute to Queen by leading the crowd in a version of Freddie Mercury's "ay-oh" chant.[292] "Hip Hop Phile" which was released when BTS's hip-hop concept was at its height, pays homage to the artists who influenced them, including the South Korean group Epik High, Jay-Z, Biggie, CL Smooth, and others.[293]

            Their 2016 album Wings was inspired by Hermann Hesse's coming of age novel, Demian.
            Their song "Blood Sweat & Tears" quotes Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra,
             and its music video features visual references to Herbert James Draper's The Lament for Icarus,
              Pieter Bruegel's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, and Bruegel's The Fall of the Rebel Angels.
              Among the literary and other sources that have inspired their works are those by Haruki Murakami, 
              Ursula K. Le Guin, Carl Jung, George Orwell and Nietzsche.
              The Love Yourself series was influenced by Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving,
               and their 2018 song "Magic Shop" from Love Yourself:
             Tear was inspired by James R. Doty's memoir Into the Magic Shop.

    </div>
  
    <div class="para-3">
        <p>
            According to Kyung Hyun Kim, BTS's rise was facilitated by a great increase in music
             video programming and consumption on YouTube and the coming of an idol empire, including
              merchandising of nonmusical products, games, and fantasy fiction, as well as an expansion
               of online music fandom.The group has a large, highly organized, online community of fans
                known as ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), which translates the
                 group's lyrics and social media posts into other languages and matches charitable 
                 contributions of BTS's members. As of 2020, some 40 million ARMY members subscribe to 
                 the band's YouTube channel, with more than 30 million following the official BTS Twitter
                  and Instagram accounts.The fan community helps generate BTS's number-one chart rankings 
                  via coordinated campaigns on streaming platforms,as well as pushes to feature BTS's music 
                  on radio stations and television.
             Some ARMY members may even surpass the group itself in influence among BTS fans
